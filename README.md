This project is a simple WebGL Shader Editor, built with Angular and Firebase.
It has webcam, micro and TensorflowJS Deep Learning Model as input, and also audio output capabilities.
The goal is a simple, fast whiteboard for creative code with GLSL.
Sketches can easily be embebed in personal sites.
